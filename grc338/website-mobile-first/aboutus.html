            Our dream has always been to own our own restaurant. To create a place that is not perfect, but gives you the feeling of being at home. With rough edges. Every day we try to give our best without forgetting ourselves. Because
            nobody is perfect. For us, the most important thing that our guests see, taste and feel is that we love what we do. That's why we have decided on the concept of a coffee house & bar. Because this combines everyday life with
            cosiness, calmness & enjoyment. A place to escape from stress. Best shown by the large windows. Outside, the pressure of time passes you by, while inside you linger with your loved ones in peace.
